# Abstraction

1. Data abstraction is the process of hiding some details and showing the user only the most important information. It 
   implies that a class conceals all other information and only exposes the characteristics and methods that are absolutely 
   necessary for a user to know. 

2. An object's characteristics and behavior set it apart from other objects of the same type and aid in identifying and organizing objects.

3. Interfaces and abstract classes help to accomplish abstraction. We can accomplish 100% abstraction by using interfaces.

#Abstract class: An abstract class must be inherited from another class in order to access it, making it a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.
#Abstract method: A method that is abstract has no body and is only applicable to abstract classes. An inherited from subclass provides the body.
