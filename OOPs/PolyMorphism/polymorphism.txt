An essential idea in Java is polymorphism, which enables objects of various classes to be handled as though they were objects of the same class.
Polymorphism is supported by object-oriented programming languages (OOPs), which makes them strong and adaptable for creating complicated applications.
The Greek words ‘poly’ and ‘morph,’ meaning ‘many’ and ‘forms,’ respectively.
 This makes the code more adaptable and reusable by enabling the usage of a single interface for several object kinds.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
5.1. compile-time polymorphism.
5.2. runtime polymorphism.
