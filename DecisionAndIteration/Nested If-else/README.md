# Nested If-Statement

In programming language, nesting an IF statement means enclosing it within another IF statement. When we want to check one condition inside another, nested If/Else is useful. Depending on the outcome of the expression, which is a boolean value (either true or false), the If Else Statement prints different sentences.
