# If-Statement

This functionality is typically used when a user wants a statement or block of statements to only be executed if one or more specified conditions are true. In other words, we can say that it evaluates a true or false Boolean condition.

# The situation is examined.

1. If Condition returns true, run the block's section of code.
   
2. Control exits the if-block and the statements following if are executed if Condition returns false.
