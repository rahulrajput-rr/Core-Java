# If-Else Statement

The 'If-Else' statement is a feature that only allows a block of code to run if a given condition is true. Another block of code can be run if the condition is false. It can be thought of as an expanded form of "If Statement."

# The situation is examined.

1. If Condition returns true, run the block's section of code.
   
2. The collection of assertions contained in the body of "else" are carried out if Condition returns false.![image]
