# Core-Java

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that places a strong emphasis on reducing implementation dependencies. It is intended to enable "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), which allows compiled Java code to operate without the need for recompilation on any platforms that support Java.  Java's reputation for simplicity, robustness, and security features make it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
